# Hear.com-Test
Hear.com UI Automation Test
<tab> Was able to write a test for each of the ui tests other than the first name on the example 2 chart. Commented out what I thought it might be.
<tab> Created this test using js and Cypress. The test will run without errors other than the one requested to be checked. 
After running the check the link opens in a new tab - need to click back to the main window to see the rest of the test run.
